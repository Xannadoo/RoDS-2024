# Exam stuff:
The exam submission is worked on **throughout** the semester (exam format C1G).

From LearnIt: 
> ... the exam submission is based on a three elements: (1) a BS journal that you can complete during the first half of the course, (2) and group project which will be developed throughout the second half of the course; and (3) a presentation where you reflect on your bachelor thesis (...) using concepts covered in the course.
